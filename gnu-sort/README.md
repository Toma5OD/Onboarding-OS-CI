# Go Sorting Program

## Description

This Go program reads lines from an input file, sorts them in ascending alphabetical order, and then writes the sorted lines to an output file.

## How It Works

- Reads lines from `input.txt` using Go's `bufio` package.
- Sorts the lines using Go's `sort` package.
- Writes the sorted lines to `sorted.txt`.

## How to Use

1. Ensure you have Go installed on your machine.
2. Place an `input.txt` file in the same directory as the Go program. This file should contain the lines you want to sort.
3. Run the program with the command `go run main.go`.
4. Check the generated `sorted.txt` for the sorted lines.
