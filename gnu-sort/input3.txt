Norm MacDonald Fake Frog story
You know, I was walking down the street the other day, minding my own business, and I saw this frog. Yeah, a frog, you heard me right. Now, you might be wondering, "What's so funny about a frog?" Well, let me tell ya, this was no ordinary frog. This frog, let's call him Fred—because what else would you name a frog?—was the funniest frog you ever did see.
You see, Fred wasn't just hopping around, catching flies like some amphibious cliché. No, sir! Fred was, get this, reading a newspaper. Yeah! A newspaper! I thought to myself, "Well, I guess he's just catching up on current 'ribbits'."
But it gets weirder! Fred puts down the newspaper, and then he starts doing push-ups! Push-ups! Now, I've seen frogs jump, but never push-up! And he wasn't just doing your run-of-the-mill push-ups; he was doing one-legged push-ups, the kind you see in those extreme workout videos that make you sweat just watching 'em.
So, I'm standing there, watching Fred the Frog doing his one-legged push-ups, and then he stops, looks up at me, and says, "Hey, you gonna join in or just stand there like a lump?" I mean, I was flabbergasted! A talking frog who reads the newspaper and does push-ups? What's next? A stand-up comedy special on Netflix?
Now, before you think I've had one too many, let me assure you, I was as sober as a judge. And speaking of judges, Fred tells me he once served on a jury. A jury! Can you believe that? He said the case was about a turtle who was accused of crossing the road too slowly. The turtle was found guilty, of course. The sentence? Two weeks of speed-walking lessons. You can't make this stuff up!
And if you think that's the pinnacle of Fred's career, oh boy, you're wrong. He once ran for mayor. Yeah, the mayor of his little pond! His campaign slogan? "Make the Pond Great Again!" He lost, though. Apparently, his opponent, a duck, promised free breadcrumbs for everyone. Tough competition, you know?
But Fred, he's a resilient guy, you know? He doesn't let setbacks get him down. After losing the election, he started a podcast. Yeah, you heard it right, a podcast! It's called "Fred's Froggy Philosophy," where he talks about the intricacies of pond life and the existential dread of being a frog in a human's world. It's surprisingly deep stuff, folks, and a bit of a ribbiting listen, if I do say so myself.
So, the next time you see a frog, don't just assume it's some simple creature hopping about. For all you know, it could be Fred, the push-up doing, newspaper-reading, jury-serving, mayor-running, podcasting frog. A truly one-of-a-kind amphibian, that Fred.
And that's the funny frog story for ya. It's strange, it's absurd, but hey, isn't life just a series of weird events strung together by the moments we laugh at?
Tim Dillon on USA
You ever take a good, long look at America? I mean, really look at it? It's like a reality show where everyone's the main character, but nobody's read the script. I mean, come on! We're the country that put a man on the moon, but we can't figure out how to put a decent cup of coffee in an airport. You're more likely to find Bigfoot in LaGuardia than a Starbucks that doesn't taste like hot garbage.
Now, let's talk about our politicians. Oh, what a cast of characters! On one side, you've got guys who look like they've been pulled straight out of a Civil War reenactment, and on the other side, you've got people who think that tweeting is a substitute for governance. "Hey guys, just passed a bill. #Winning!" No, you're not winning; you're embarrassing yourself!
And don't get me started on the media. CNN, Fox News, MSNBC—it's like choosing between different flavors of poison. "Would you like your news with a side of fear-mongering, or would you prefer it dipped in a vat of bias?" It's like deciding whether you want to be kicked in the face or punched in the gut. Either way, you're walking away hurt.
But then, there's the American Dream. Ah, yes, the belief that if you work hard enough, you can achieve anything. You know who really believes in the American Dream? Pyramid scheme recruiters. They're the only people on the planet who can look you in the eye and say, "Invest in essential oils, and one day you'll have a yacht," without bursting into laughter.
Now, let's talk about American holidays. Fourth of July, right? We celebrate our freedom by blowing stuff up. It's like saying, "Hey, we're free! Now let's scare every dog within a five-mile radius." And Thanksgiving? We gather around a table to eat ourselves into a coma and argue about politics. Because nothing says "I'm thankful" like screaming at Uncle Bob about tax reform while you're three helpings deep into mashed potatoes.
But here's the kicker, folks: despite all its flaws, quirks, and downright absurdities, America is still the place where everyone wants to be. Why? Because even though we might be a hot mess, we're a hot mess with options. You can go from being broke to being a billionaire, from being unknown to being a viral sensation, all because you live in a place that, for all its faults, allows you to be whoever you want to be—even if that's just a guy ranting about how ridiculous his country is.
