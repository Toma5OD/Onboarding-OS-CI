### Differences between OpenShift and Kubernetes:

1. **Origin**: 
    - Kubernetes is an open-source platform.
    - OpenShift is Red Hat's enterprise distribution of Kubernetes.

2. **Installation & Setup**: 
    - Kubernetes offers more flexibility but can be complex to set up.
    - OpenShift provides a streamlined installation process.

3. **User Interface**: 
    - Kubernetes mostly relies on CLI.
    - OpenShift provides a comprehensive web-based UI.

4. **Security**: 
    - OpenShift has built-in security features like SELinux.
    - Kubernetes leaves more security configurations to the user.

5. **Integrated Tools**: 
    - OpenShift includes integrated CI/CD, monitoring, and logging solutions.
    - Kubernetes offers these as separate installations.

6. **Network Policy**: 
    - OpenShift uses OpenShift SDN, and supports third-party plugins.
    - Kubernetes uses a pluggable model and supports various plugins like Calico.

7. **Routing**: 
    - OpenShift has built-in HTTP(S) routing.
    - Kubernetes requires an ingress controller for HTTP(S) routing.

8. **API Objects**: 
    - OpenShift introduces additional API objects like Build, BuildConfig, and DeploymentConfig.
    - Kubernetes uses native API objects.

9. **CLI**: 
    - Kubernetes uses `kubectl`.
    - OpenShift uses `oc`, which wraps `kubectl` and adds additional features.

10. **Enterprise Support**: 
    - OpenShift comes with Red Hatâ€™s enterprise support.
    - Kubernetes relies on the community or third-party vendors for support.

This is a high-level overview; the actual differences can be more nuanced.
